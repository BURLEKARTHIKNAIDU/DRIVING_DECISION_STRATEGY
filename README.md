# DRIVING_DECISION_STRATEGY



## 📌 Driving Decision Strategy Based on Machine Learning

### 📖 Project Description

This project focuses on designing an intelligent **driving decision strategy using Machine Learning** to support safe and efficient vehicle decision-making. The system analyzes driving-related data such as speed, distance, road conditions, and surrounding objects to predict optimal driving actions like acceleration, braking, and lane decisions.

By applying machine learning algorithms, the model learns patterns from historical driving data and makes real-time decisions that aim to reduce accidents, improve traffic efficiency, and enhance overall driving safety. This project demonstrates how data-driven models can be used in **autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicle systems**.

The project is implemented using **Python** and popular ML libraries, focusing on data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
